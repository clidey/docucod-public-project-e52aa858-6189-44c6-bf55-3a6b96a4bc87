# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page outlines the essential requirements to successfully use **GORM Data Types** in your Go applications. This includes supported Go versions, required GORM dependencies, and the database platforms that seamlessly integrate with the library. It also highlights platform-specific notes to ensure smooth setup and avoid common pitfalls.

---

## 1. Supported Go Versions

- **Minimum Go version:** Go 1.18 or later.
  - The library uses generics and advanced type features introduced in Go 1.18.
  - Ensure your Go environment is up to date to leverage full functionality.

<Tip>
Using an outdated Go version can result in compilation errors or missing features, especially due to GORM Data Types leveraging generics introduced in Go 1.18.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Required Dependencies

Before integrating GORM Data Types, confirm your project includes the following:

- **GORM ORM** (gorm.io/gorm): Core ORM library.
- **Database Drivers** (matching your database):
  - MySQL: gorm.io/driver/mysql
  - PostgreSQL: gorm.io/driver/postgres
  - SQLite: gorm.io/driver/sqlite
  - SQLServer: gorm.io/driver/sqlserver

Ensure these drivers are imported and initialized correctly in your project alongside GORM Data Types.

---

## 3. Supported Database Platforms

GORM Data Types is designed to be cross-database compatible, supporting the most common databases with JSON, Date, Time, and UUID data types:

| Database    | JSON Support               | Notes                                             |
|-------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| MySQL       | JSON native type           | MariaDB limited support for JSON casts            |
| PostgreSQL  | JSONB with advanced ops    | Full support for JSON and atomic JSON updates     |
| SQLite      | JSON via json1 extension   | Requires sqlite driver built with `json1` tag     |
| SQLServer   | JSON via NVARCHAR + funcs | Supports UUID and date/time types                  |

<Tip>
SQLite users must build their Go projects using the `json1` build tag to enable JSON support. For example:

```
go build --tags json1
```
This ensures the underlying SQLite driver supports JSON operations.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Platform-Specific Requirements

### SQLite
- Must build with the `json1` tag.
- SQLite JSON columns are stored as `TEXT` due to SQLite limitations.

### MariaDB
- MariaDB does not support casts to JSON (`CAST(? AS JSON)`) used by some JSON update operations.
- JSON features will work, but certain atomic JSON update capabilities are limited.

### PostgreSQL
- Advanced JSONB operations and atomic JSON updates are fully supported.

### SQLServer
- Supports UUID and JSON emulation but with different underlying implementation.

---

## 5. Environment Variable Support for Testing

The package includes an internal automated test suite configurable by environment variables:

- `GORM_DIALECT` - Set to specify the target database dialect for testing (e.g., `mysql`, `postgres`, `sqlite`, `sqlserver`).
- `GORM_DSN` - DSN connection string for database connection, fallback provided for default local configurations.

These variables help adapt integration tests to your local or CI environment but are primarily for development.

---

## 6. Summary Checklist Before You Begin

- [ ] Go version 1.18 or later installed.
- [ ] GORM and appropriate database driver included in your project.
- [ ] Selected database is one of MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite (with json1), or SQLServer.
- [ ] For SQLite, build with `json1` tag enabled.
- [ ] Database server configured and accessible (credentials, host, port).

<Tip>
Ensure your database user has the necessary permissions to create schemas and tables, especially when running migrations with GORM Data Types.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup & Prerequisite Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Mismatch">
If you encounter errors related to generics or unsupported language features, verify your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

Update if below 1.18:

```bash
go install golang.org/dl/go1.18@latest
go1.18 download
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="SQLite JSON Support Not Working">
Check if you compiled with the `json1` tag:

```bash
go build --tags json1
```
Without this, SQLite will not handle JSON columns properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="MariaDB JSON Casts Failure">
MariaDB lacks support for `CAST(? AS JSON)` which some JSONSet operations use.

Workaround: avoid atomic JSON updates using casts or switch to MySQL or PostgreSQL for full support.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Database Connection Issues">
Confirm DSN string and network connectivity:

- Verify username, password, port, and host.
- Run a standalone database client connection test.

Set `GORM_DSN` environment variable to your DSN before running tests:

```bash
export GORM_DSN="user:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/dbname"
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
