# Install GORM Data Types

Integrate the GORM Data Types package into your Go project with ease by following this step-by-step guide. This page will walk you through adding the package to your Go modules, fetching the source code correctly, and addressing special considerations for SQLite JSON support.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installation, ensure your development environment meets these requirements:

- **Go Version:** Minimum Go 1.18 or later for generics support
- **GORM ORM:** Use with GORM v2 or later, as datatypes integrate directly
- **Supported Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite (with JSON1 extension), and SQLServer
- **SQLite JSON Support:** SQLite requires building with `json1` enabled (`go build --tags json1`)

<Check>
Ensure your Go environment is configured properly and GORM is set up before adding GORM Data Types.
</Check>

## 2. Installation Instructions

### Add GORM Data Types with Go Modules

Add the package to your project by running the following command in your project root:

```bash
go get gorm.io/datatypes@latest
```

This command fetches the latest version of GORM Data Types from the official repository.

### Import the Package in Your Go Code

Include the datatypes package where you define your GORM models:

```go
import "gorm.io/datatypes"
```

### Module Dependency Verification

After fetching, verify your `go.mod` includes:

```
require gorm.io/datatypes vX.Y.Z
```

where `vX.Y.Z` is the installed version.

### Handling SQLite JSON1

SQLite does not enable JSON support by default. To use JSON features:

- Build your Go program with the `json1` build tag:

```bash
go build --tags json1
```

- This ensures the SQLite driver includes JSON capabilities.

### Verify Fetch Source

GORM Data Types is hosted at [https://github.com/go-gorm/datatypes](https://github.com/go-gorm/datatypes). Your module will fetch directly from here.

## 3. Verification of Installation

Confirm successful installation by compiling a simple test program:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"gorm.io/datatypes"
)

func main() {
	// Demonstrate usage of JSON type
	userAttrs := datatypes.JSON([]byte(`{"name": "test", "age": 30}`))
	fmt.Println("User Attributes JSON:", string(userAttrs))
}
```

Build and run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Expected output:

```
User Attributes JSON: {"name": "test", "age": 30}
```

If this compiles and runs without errors, the package is installed and imported correctly.

## 4. Additional Notes and Best Practices

- **Compatibility:** Always verify your target database supports JSON types as expected, especially MariaDB, which has limitations with JSON casting.
- **Version Pinning:** For production projects, specify a stable version instead of `@latest` for predictable builds.
- **SQLite Build:** Remember the `json1` tag in builds to avoid runtime JSON errors with SQLite.

## 5. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Installation Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Go Module Not Found or Version Conflicts">
- Run `go clean -modcache` to clear cached errors
- Verify your internet connection
- Check your `go.mod` and `go.sum` for consistency
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="SQLite JSON Errors">
- Ensure you compile with `--tags json1`
- Confirm your SQLite driver version supports JSON
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Errors Due to Missing Package">
- Verify your import path is `gorm.io/datatypes`
- Run `go mod tidy` to fix missing dependencies
</Accordion>
